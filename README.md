A project for Sprint Week 2 of Intro to Python (Semester 1).

A program to allow a DJI Robomaster S1 to run an obstacle course around Keyin College. There are 4 rooms which the robot will enter, 
and each room can contain one of the following scenarios:
1) a fire that needs to be put out.
2) a person to rescue by bringing them back to the start, and then the robot must return to where it was to continue the course.
3) a room too hazardous to enter.

The robot will scan a marker at each door which will tell it which scenario each room contains, and these can change at any time.
